\section{Synthetic Sequence Dataset}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Synthetic Sequence Dataset}
For this practice I prepared a \textbf{synthetic dataset} consisting in $\bm{2^{20}}$ \textbf{binary sequences}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
You can find it in \texttt{synthetic\_dataset.py}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Loading the data is as simple as:
\begin{verbatim}
from synthetic_dataset import SyntheticSequenceDataset
synthetic_dataset   = SyntheticSequenceDataset()
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\section{Learning to Count}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Goal}
Our task is to \textbf{count the number of ones in the binary sequences}.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
The goal of this practice is to implement and train a \textbf{LSTM} \cite{hochreiter1997long} network to do so.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Useful Functions}
To this purpose, you may find useful the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell}
\item \texttt{tf.nn.dynamic\_rnn}
\item \texttt{tf.transpose}
\item \texttt{tf.gather}
\item \texttt{tf.layers.dense}
\end{itemize}
Please refer to the docs to know the exact API.
